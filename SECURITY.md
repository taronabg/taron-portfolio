# Security Implementation for Taron Abgaryan Portfolio Website

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented on the Taron Abgaryan portfolio website to protect against common web vulnerabilities and attacks.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. HTTP Security Headers
All HTML pages include the following security headers:
- **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff** - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options: DENY** - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block** - Enables XSS protection
- **Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin** - Controls referrer information
- **Permissions-Policy** - Restricts browser features (geolocation, camera, etc.)

### 2. Content Security Policy (CSP)
Implemented via .htaccess and meta tags:
- Restricts script sources to trusted domains
- Prevents inline script execution (except where necessary)
- Controls resource loading from external sources
- Blocks frame embedding

### 3. Form Security Enhancements
Contact form includes:
- **Input Validation**: Server-side and client-side validation
- **Input Sanitization**: Removes potentially dangerous characters
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based protection against cross-site request forgery
- **Honeypot Fields**: Hidden fields to catch automated bots
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents form spam (30-second intervals)
- **Length Restrictions**: Maximum character limits on all inputs
- **Pattern Validation**: Regex patterns for email, phone, and name validation

### 4. JavaScript Security
- **Strict Mode**: All scripts use 'use strict'
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized before processing
- **XSS Prevention**: Comprehensive validation against script injection
- **Developer Tools Prevention**: Blocks common developer tool shortcuts
- **Context Menu Prevention**: Disables right-click context menu

### 5. Server-Side Security (.htaccess)
- **Directory Browsing**: Disabled to prevent information disclosure
- **File Access Control**: Blocks access to sensitive file types
- **Bot Protection**: Blocks known malicious user agents
- **Hotlink Protection**: Prevents image and resource theft
- **Suspicious Request Blocking**: Blocks common attack patterns
- **Rate Limiting**: Server-side rate limiting (if available)

### 6. Input Validation Patterns
- **Name**: 2-100 characters, letters, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes only
- **Email**: Standard email format with additional security checks
- **Phone**: International format with validation
- **Message**: 10-2000 characters with XSS prevention

### 7. External Resource Security
- **CDN Integrity**: Scripts loaded with integrity checks
- **Cross-Origin**: Proper CORS configuration
- **HTTPS Only**: All external resources use HTTPS
- **Trusted Sources**: Only load from verified CDNs

### 8. Performance & Security
- **Gzip Compression**: Reduces bandwidth and improves security
- **Browser Caching**: Optimized caching headers
- **Resource Optimization**: Minimized external dependencies
